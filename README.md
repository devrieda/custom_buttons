## Custom Buttons

While browser default buttons are perfectly fine in many instances, there are 
times you want to give your buttons a little more class. Styling buttons to 
behave predictably in all browsers is rather tricky. 

This project contains XHTML/CSS to change the visual style of both the 
`<button>` and `<a>` tag using a *button* class. It aims to use semantically 
correct markup and maintain the various button states (in supported browsers).


## Examples

There are two different button examples -- a round button, and a more 
rectangular button. 

Tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. 

Round Button: 

```
<button type="submit" class="button round_button"><span>Submit</span></button>
<a href="#" class="button round_button"><span>Submit</span></a>
```

Rectangular Button:   
  
```
<button type="submit" class="button rect_button"><span>Submit</span></button> 
<a href="#" class="button rect_button"><span>Submit</span></a>
```  

Add the *primary* class to make a button bolded: 

```
<button type="submit" class="button round_button primary"><span>Submit</span></button>
```

Add the *disabled* class to make a button faded:

```
<button type="submit" class="button round_button disabled"><span>Submit</span></button>
```
