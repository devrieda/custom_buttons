While browser default buttons are perfectly fine in many instances, there are times you want to give your buttons a little more class. Styling buttons to behave predictably in all browsers is rather tricky. 

This project contains XHTML/CSS to change the visual style of both the <button> and <a> tag using a "button" class. It aims to use semantically correct markup and maintain the various button states (in supported browsers).

There are two different button examples -- a round button, and a more rectangular button. 

Tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. 

A lot of what I've done is based on previous work demoed in these articles, and their comments:
